GameEngineSimulationTest
========================

GameEngineSimulationTest

  This is a revamp of a previous engine construct but rather more refactored and more flexible for
  mobile and desktop. It has its own debug mode just as the box2d does but, using SDL 2.0 and has 
  touch screen input. And yes a test simulation for the Local Butida game.
  
  Further refinement will take place on the eingine as time goes on and also as i find more time to work on it.
  Waiting to add a JSON parser for bodies created using Physics body editor .
